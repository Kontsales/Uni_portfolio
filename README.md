This repository acts as a portfolio of code written by me during the studies for my M.Sc (Tech.) in Electrical Engineering at LUT-University. 
As I specialized in embedded systems, most of the code is from different course assignments utilizing either an Arduino or the Zybo-Z7-10 development board.
Many of the assignments were completed in a group so the code provided might not constitute a complete project, but showcases only the code I was responsible for.

Each folder includes a README-file that explains the broader context of the code and the aim of the assignment on a basic level.

Here is a brief introduction to each of the projects provided:
